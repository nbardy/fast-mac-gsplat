## Current Read

This fork is not a separate thesis from STAR-UVT. It is the moving-camera
completion path for STAR-UVT's sublinear goal: keep one world-space primitive
covering many frames, compile the camera path into a compact sensor-time tube,
and keep rasterization in `(u, v, t)`.

The first runnable proof is projection-only plus dense reference. It does not
claim Metal speed or training quality yet. The audit proves the core center-curve
reason to fork:

```text
moving camera affine center error: 2.0354537963867188 px
moving camera PRT center error:    3.814697265625e-06 px
```

The projection-only scaling probe keeps the same conclusion across longer
windows:

```text
8 frames:  affine error 0.5121097564697266 px, PRT error 3.0517578125e-05 px
16 frames: affine error 1.8731575012207031 px, PRT error 3.0517578125e-05 px
32 frames: affine error 10.037454605102539 px, PRT error 3.0517578125e-05 px
```

The timing numbers in that probe are CPU diagnostics only. They do not prove
sublinear rendering speed; the next speed claim has to come from a tiled Metal
PRT path with dense-vs-Metal parity.

Gate B0 now has a compiled extension namespace and direct Metal PRT forward op:

```text
dense vs CPU brute PRT max error:   0.0
dense vs direct Metal PRT max error: 1.7881393432617188e-07
```

This is deliberately a direct per-pixel Metal reference op. It proves the
compiled API and rational-center semantics, but it is not the sublinear tiled
rasterizer yet. Gate B1 is where the actual STAR-UVT speed path starts.

Gate B1 now has a tiled Metal PRT bin-and-render path:

```text
dense vs tiled Metal PRT max error: 5.960464477539063e-08
active tiles: 24
max tile count: 2
overflow tiles: 0
```

The first tiled path uses sample-level depth selection inside each tile. That is
the conservative correctness-first version; Gate B2 still has to measure tile
load, timing, and whether stable depth shortcuts are worth adding.

Gate B2 timing probe:

```text
16 tubes:  direct median 2.165500001865439 ms, tiled median 3.4470835016691126 ms, ratio 1.5918187479564403
64 tubes:  direct median 6.6889790032291785 ms, tiled median 5.393875493609812 ms, ratio 0.8063824824395261
128 tubes: direct median 16.94479199795751 ms, tiled median 15.051396498165559 ms, ratio 0.8882609181617469
```

The same setup at 256 tubes fails the default-capacity gate with `15` overflow
tiles and max error `0.21615934371948242`. That is the next concrete scaling
blocker: either raise/segment capacity, tighten support bounds, or split camera
windows before claiming useful-scale speed. The no-overflow timing rows are
diagnostic and noisy; they are not a training-speed claim.

Gate B3 capacity-256 smoke:

```text
256 tubes, tile_capacity=256: direct median 17.852812503406312 ms, tiled median 15.45362549222773 ms, ratio 0.8656129385372294
max tile count: 152
overflow tiles: 0
max error vs direct: 5.364418029785156e-07
```

This shows the 256-tube failure was a capacity overflow, not a PRT binning math
failure. It does not solve default-capacity scaling; the next useful work is to
tighten support bounds, split camera windows, or make capacity selection part of
the cost model.

The new idea added in this fork is the curvature-selective hybrid compiler:
low-curvature tubes can stay on the old affine UVT path, while only high-curvature
moving-camera tubes use PRT. That is meant to preserve STAR-UVT's cheap path
instead of forcing every tube through the more expensive rational shader.

The next idea queued after tiled Metal forward is residual-certified footprint
inflation: use a small exact-projection probe to estimate the camera polynomial's
pixel residual and inflate only the PRT support bound needed to cover it. This
should be measured before splitting a camera window.

## Next Gates

1. Fix default-capacity scaling with support tightening, segmentation, or a capacity cost model.
2. Add tile-load scaling scenes that stress moving-camera curvature.
3. Decide whether stable depth shortcuts are worth adding or whether sample-level ordering is the right first training path.
4. Add timing flags for `--uvt-camera-sequence-mode projective_rational`.
5. Only after forward timing, add direct-atomic exploratory backward plus a deterministic reporting fallback.
